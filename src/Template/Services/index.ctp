            <li class="progression_active">Form16 Signer Software</li>
            <div class="div_progression_toggle closed">Enterprise software to affix digital signature certificates on Form 16 PDFs. Saves millions of sheets of paper by doing away the need of physically signed Form 16. Supports all types of DSC.

                The backend applications such as the payroll application are used to generate the Form 16 details, which contain income, deductions, investments, and other income tax related details pertaining to an employee. These details are then printed onto a prescribed format and an authorized signatory affixes his/her signatures.  When this document is rendered digitally and signed using a digital signature certificate, it is a legally empowered document acceptable in the courts of law. In order to facilitate this, it is necessary to incorporate digital signature capabilities in the backend application, which is non-trivial, or use a digital signature application which can take the inputs from the backend application, create the Form 16, digitally sign it, and email it to the recipient. 

                Taxspanner Form 16 Signer software meets the requirements of signing Form 16, its distribution via email and (optional) e-filing facilitation to employees. Form 16 signer is a stand-alone extension of the Form 16 PDF Software. It can either be used in conjunction with generation of Form 16 or it can be used to only affix digital signatures to already generated PDF Form 16s.

                Key features of Form 16 Signer Software
